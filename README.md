# Tesla Connect

Note: This is in Beta and full functionality is not awailable. 

Adds support for interacting with your Tesla. I created this to have a secure and low energy consuming app for my cars. You will need to keep this app up to date, since some of the credentials are changing from time to time, and the App will need update to the source code to reflect these changes. 

For now the App only keep the car online when needed, so battery will not drain as fast as some other solutions. Consequence is that geofence and similar functionality can not be implemented for now.

However, it is possible that use of this app may cause unexpected damage for which nobody but you are responsible. Negative consequences such as, but not limited to, unlocking the doors, opening the sun roof, or reducing the available charge in the battery.
