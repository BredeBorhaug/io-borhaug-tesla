    "en": "Note: This is in Beta and full functionality is not awailable. /n Adds support for interacting with your Tesla. I created this to have a secure and low energy consuming app for my cars. You will need to keep this app up to date, since some of the credentials are changing from time to time, and the App will need update to the source code to reflect these changes. For now the App does not keep the car connection all the time, so battery will not drain as fast as some other solutions. Consequence is that geo-fence and similar is not awailable."
